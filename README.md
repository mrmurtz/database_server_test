#Database server tech test

The first tech test of week 10 at Makers Academy.

###The brief

You receive a message from a prospective employer:

"Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on http://localhost:4000/. When your server receives a request on http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey it should return the value stored at somekey.

During your [mock] interview, you will pair on saving the data to a file."

Create a new git repository and write code to fulfill the brief to the best of your ability. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code.
